This is a horror game I made for "Pygame Community Halloween Jam 2022".

The game is simple to play.   The player uses the arrow keys to control the movement of the main character.   Players can also get items on the map and put them in packs, then click to use them.

The theme of the jam is "Nearsighted/blind", so you need to get firewood to light the torch as you move.   Otherwise, it will get darker and darker!

The game has two endings (none good, but one of them is better than the other).

The inspiration contributor for this game was WuxiaScrub.   The game is a licensed parody of his "Wuxia World" game.
